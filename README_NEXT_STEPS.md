## 🚀 What to Do RIGHT NOW (Next 30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open QUICK_START.md
```bash
# In your IDE, open:
/home/piotr/projects/EcoDataExtractor/QUICK_START.md
```

### Step 2: Answer 3 Questions
Before writing any code, answer:
1. **UI Framework**: MUI (feature-rich) or Shadcn/ui (lightweight)?
2. **State Manager**: Zustand (simple) or Redux (powerful)?
3. **Styling**: Tailwind (utility) or CSS Modules (scoped)?

**Recommendation**: Zustand + MUI + Tailwind (balanced approach)

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /home/piotr/projects/EcoDataExtractor/frontend

# Essential
npm install react-router-dom zustand axios

# UI Framework (pick one)
npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
# OR
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Step 4: Create Folder Structure (2 minutes)
```bash
mkdir -p src/{components/layout,components/upload,components/categories,components/model-config,components/extraction,components/results,components/common}
mkdir -p src/{pages,services,store,types,theme,utils,styles}
```

### Step 5: Verify Backend Works (1 minute)
```bash
# In another terminal:
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Visit: http://localhost:8000/health
# Should see: {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}
```

## 📋 This Week's Goals

**Goal**: Create navigable app shell with state management

- [ ] Read QUICK_START.md
- [ ] Decide on UI/State/Styling frameworks
- [ ] Install dependencies
- [ ] Create folder structure
- [ ] Setup React Router (5 pages)
- [ ] Create Zustand stores (3 stores)
- [ ] Create API client service
- [ ] Create Layout component
- [ ] Verify app navigates between pages

**Outcome**: Ugly but functional skeleton app ✅

## 🎨 First Component to Build

After setup, build the **Layout** component:

```tsx
// src/components/layout/Layout.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Header } from './Header';
import { Footer } from './Footer';

export const Layout: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      <Header />
      <main style={{ flex: 1, padding: '20px' }}>
        <Outlet />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## ✅ This Week Success Criteria

You'll know you're on track if by Friday:

- ✅ App runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ App has 5 working pages (blank is fine)
- ✅ Navigation between pages works
- ✅ Backend running on `:8000`
- ✅ Frontend running on `:5173`
- ✅ Zustand stores created and importable
- ✅ API client service created
- ✅ Layout component shows header/footer/content

---

## 🔄 Workflow Going Forward

### For Each Component (50-100 line estimate per)

1. **Create TypeScript interface** (Props type)
2. **Write component skeleton** (basic JSX)
3. **Add state management** (Zustand or local state)
4. **Connect to backend API** (axios calls)
5. **Style with MUI/Tailwind** (make it look good)
6. **Test in browser** (visual check)
7. **Commit to git** (one feature per commit)

### Example: Creating FileUploader Component

```bash
# 1. Create file
touch src/components/upload/FileUploader.tsx

# 2. Write component (copy from NEXT_STEPS.md for reference)
# - Define interface
# - Handle drag-drop
# - Call backend API
# - Show loading state

# 3. Export from index (optional but good practice)
echo "export * from './FileUploader';" >> src/components/upload/index.ts

# 4. Use in ExtractionPage
# import FileUploader from '../components/upload'
# <FileUploader onUpload={...} />

# 5. Test in browser with backend running

# 6. Commit
git add src/components/upload/
git commit -m "feat: Add FileUploader component"
```

## 🆘 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't skip the roadmap** - Read NEXT_STEPS.md before coding
2. **Don't skip setup** - Proper folder structure saves hours later
3. **Don't hardcode API URLs** - Use environment variables
4. **Don't forget TypeScript** - Types catch errors early
5. **Don't build the perfect component** - Build working, improve later
6. **Don't test only in browser** - Use browser DevTools network tab to verify API calls

## 🎯 Questions Answered by Your New Docs

### "What should I build first?"
→ Read NEXT_STEPS.md Priority 1 (Foundation)

### "What are the backend endpoints?"
→ QUICK_START.md Backend section or backend/app/routers/

### "How do I structure components?"
→ NEXT_STEPS.md has full directory tree and component breakdown

### "What should I test?"
→ IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md has testing section

### "How long will this take?"
→ 8 weeks estimated in roadmap (can vary by complexity)

### "Can I use Database?"
→ Not needed yet - stay with in-memory storage as requested

### "Can I make it async?"
→ Not needed yet - keep synchronous processing

## 📞 When You Get Stuck

### Check These in Order:
1. **QUICK_START.md** - Common troubleshooting section
2. **NEXT_STEPS.md** - Detailed component specs
3. **Backend logs** - `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
4. **Browser console** - F12 DevTools
5. **Network tab** - Check actual API requests

### Common Issues:
```bash
# CORS error?
→ Backend CORS configured for localhost:3000 and localhost:5173

# Component not showing?
→ Check React Router setup in App.tsx

# API call failing?
→ Check backend running: curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Import errors?
→ Check folder structure matches NEXT_STEPS.md
```

## 📖 Reading Order

1. **Now** (5 min): This file (README_NEXT_STEPS.md)
2. **Next** (30 min): QUICK_START.md - Get oriented
3. **Then** (1 hour): NEXT_STEPS.md Priority 1 - Detailed plan
4. **Start building** (weeks 1-2): Follow Priority 1 tasks
